## Arduino Sketch Dependencies
I've had issues with the sketch when using the latest esp8266 Arduino core. I found things to be stable when using esp8266 v2.74 Arduino core.

This sketch has been confirmed to work with the following libraries:
- PubSubClient v2.8.0
- ArduinoJson v6.17.2
- FastLED v3.5.0
- OneButton v2.0.4

## Android App
The android app is still a work in progress, you can find an alpha version of the apk in this repo. The finished version along with the source code will be released soon!
